In the far future (2024), Robots have come to dominate the earth.

As the last human resistance desperately fights to hang on, a mad scientist unleashes the undead in a desperate gamble to reverse the tides.

This action has only increased the Robots assessment of the probabilities of the correctness of their drive for domination.

You are a Robot centurion tasked with wiping out the Zombie scum.

You have been deployed to a remote outpost, with beacons designed to attract zombie hordes.

Wipe out as many of the zombies as you can. Make the hiveminds investments worthwhile...
